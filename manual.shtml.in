<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
Currently tested platforms:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>Cobalt Qube 1 with Linux RH 5.1 (mips 2.0.34 kernel)</code>;
<code>Windows XP Pro SP2</code>;
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
When using Roundhouse on the same server as two or more Sendmail daemons,
each Sendmail instance must be listening on a port other than 25, which 
Roundhouse will be listening on. Either modify each daemon's sendmail.mc/cf
file or specify the command line option -ODaemonPortOptions=Port=NNN. For example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
	# sendmail -ODaemonPortOptions=Port=26
	# sendmail -ODaemonPortOptions=Port=27	
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Then start Roundhouse to multiplex to the two local Sendmail daemons:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
	# roundhouse 127.0.0.1:26 ::1,27 other.host.example.com
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that Roundhouse supports IPv6 addresses, but in order to distinguish
between the address and the port, a comma or other punctuation character
must be used instead of a colon. 
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
Roundhouse does not currently multiplex STARTTLS sessions. Instead
it forwards the STARTTLS and the remainder of the input stream to the first
SMTP server in the server list. This should be your primary SMTP server.
</p>

<li><p>
Roundhouse supports AUTH PLAIN and AUTH LOGIN. An AUTH LOGIN is converted
to an AUTH PLAIN before being forwarded to the SMTP server list.
</li>
